## Introduction
GPU computing is becoming a mainstream programming paradigm and in some cases GPU computing is the only practical solution to i
challenging problems. OpenACC could be considered as the path of least resistance when starting GPU computing. Similar to 
OpenMP, OpenACC is a directive-based standard to convert parts of your code to run on GPU. In this workshop, participants 
will learn about OpenACC directives, different memory allocation modes, and will have a chance to write some code to run on GPU. 
Although both C and Fortran code is provided, only the C version will be discussed in the workshop.

## Topics covered
* Using OpenACC directives
* Writing simple OpenACC-enabled code in C
* Compiling and running OpenACC code
* Memory allocation and data management

## Goals
* Participants will be able to identify and explain OpenACC directives
* Participants will be able to add OpenACC directives to a program to run it on GPU
* Participants will be able to identify different memory allocation modes

## Prerequisite
Participants are expected to have an experience in C or Fortran programming.
